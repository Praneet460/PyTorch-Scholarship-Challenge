## About PyTorch

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source Python framework from the [Facebook AI Research](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/) team used for developing deep neural networks. PyTorch as an extension of [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) that has some convenience classes for defining neural networks and accelerated computations using GPUs. PyTorch is designed with a Python-first philosophy, it follows Python conventions and idioms, and works perfectly alongside popular Python packages.
